## The Importance Of Using A Planner

    Do you find that there is never enough time for everything? If so, it is probably because you are not scheduling your time effectively. This happens when you just run constantly, going from one thing to the next, without really thinking about everything as a whole. Using a planner allows you to schedule each event, appointment, errand, and task, so that you know what to expect and donâ€™t run out of time. Set specific due dates and deadlines for everything to help you stay on track.
